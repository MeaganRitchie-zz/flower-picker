## To Do:

* add more flowers and details to database
* add more search fields (one for each detail)
* some of the search fields can be dropdowns https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select
* search function code will need to be updated to handle when search fields are empty or not (perhaps switch statement)
* add some sort of popup information when a flower card is clicked
* come up with a better title
* styling!
